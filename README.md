# The Revenue Recognition Problem

// TODO: Add article link

## Notes

- To simplify the implementation, use cases classes are singletons. They should be classes with public interfacesl and they should be injected were they are needed.
- `RevenueRecognition.isRecognizableBy()` could be a use case, but I think that would be an over design.
